# EventMasterAngular
Welcome to my Github repository!

• Created a robust web application that leverages Node.js, TypeScript, Ticketmaster API, Spotify API, Google Maps API, Ipinfo API,
and AJAX to showcase event, artist and venue details.<br>
• To craft an engaging user experience, I employed AngularJS, JavaScript, jQuery, HTML5, and Bootstrap for the client-side
scripting, and deployed the application on the Google Cloud platform for optimal performance and accessibility.

Please find the demo video for the project [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10sAQWYjTvnbFYkPwOZ__SQ0S6WfSk0MI/view?usp=share_link)
